IoT Telemetry Platform â€“ Interview Submission
________________________________________
A Note to the Reviewer
Thank you for taking the time to review my submission.
This project is fully containerized using Docker and Docker Compose to ensure a simple and reliable setup. The recommended way to run the application is with a single command, which will launch the entire stackâ€”including the backend, frontend, database, MQTT broker, and the device simulator.
The core real-time functionality is implemented using Socket.IO, allowing the backend to push live updates directly to the frontend as soon as new data is received from the MQTT broker.
ðŸ‘‰ Telemetry data is updated every 5 seconds, ensuring the dashboard reflects the latest device readings continuously.

Features Implemented
â€¢	Real-time Dashboard: The main device list and the detailed modal view both update in real-time without needing a page refresh.
â€¢	Correct Little-Endian Decoding: The backend correctly decodes the little-endian float values for temperature, humidity, and PM2.5.
â€¢	Secure Authentication: API endpoints are secured using a JWT-based authentication strategy.
â€¢	Robust API: A RESTful API provides endpoints for fetching device lists (with latest data) and historical readings.
â€¢	Full Dockerization: The entire application stack is containerized for easy setup and consistent deployment.
â€¢	Device Simulation: A simulator script runs automatically to publish telemetry data every 5 seconds, allowing for immediate testing and visualization.

Instructions to Run the Project
Prerequisites
â€¢	Docker Desktop
________________________________________
Step 1: Unzip the Project Folder
Unzip the iot-project.zip file you received. This will create the project directory.
________________________________________
Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate into the root of the unzipped project folder:
cd path/to/the/unzipped-project-folder
________________________________________
Step 3: Seed the Database
Before logging in, you need to seed the database with initial user data. Run the following command from the backend folder:
cd backend
node seed.js
This will create the default admin user required for login.
________________________________________
Step 4: Launch the Application with Docker
Go back to the root project folder and run the following command:
docker-compose up --build
This command will build the necessary Docker images and start all services.
Please allow a few moments for initializationâ€”the device simulator will start automatically and begin sending telemetry data every 5 seconds.
